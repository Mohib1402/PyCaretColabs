        "# 👋 PyCaret Anomaly Detection Tutorial\n",
        "\n",
        "PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows. It is an end-to-end machine learning and model management tool that exponentially speeds up the experiment cycle and makes you more productive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compared with the other open-source machine learning libraries, PyCaret is an alternate low-code library that can be used to replace hundreds of lines of code with a few lines only. This makes experiments exponentially fast and efficient. PyCaret is essentially a Python wrapper around several machine learning libraries and frameworks, such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, spaCy, Optuna, Hyperopt, Ray, and a few more.\n",
        "\n",
        "The design and simplicity of PyCaret are inspired by the emerging role of citizen data scientists, a term first used by Gartner. Citizen Data Scientists are power users who can perform both simple and moderately sophisticated analytical tasks that would previously have required more technical expertise.\n"

        "The `predict_model` function returns `Anomaly` and `Anomaly_Score` label as a new column in the input dataframe. This step may or may not be needed depending on the use-case. Some times clustering models are trained for analysis purpose only and the interest of user is only in assigned labels on the training dataset, that can be done using `assign_model` function. `predict_model` is only useful when you want to obtain cluster labels on unseen data (i.e. data that was not used during training the model)."
